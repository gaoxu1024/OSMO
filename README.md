### Usage of the demo

1. Our project is written in Python 2.7 and PyTorch 0.2. Please set the environment at first.

2. Download the CampusStone dataset from https://drive.google.com/open?id=1nL60VdWkOkvjkdkAY53cuuLbV6wBStSn and unzip the file.

3. Download the code using "git clone https://github.com/gaoxu1024/OSMO.git".

4. Put the unziped dataset into ./dataset/.

5. For testing, use "sh osmo_run_list.sh".

We provide our tracking results in the folder ./result/. Besides, we only present the CampusStone dataset here currently, since other three datasets may have some private problems with the government.
